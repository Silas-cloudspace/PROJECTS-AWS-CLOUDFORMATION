## LINK WITH THE STEPS TO COMPLETE THIS PROJECT: 


STEP BY STEP FLOW

Step 1: Create the Private S3 Bucket
•	Resource: S3Bucket
•	Purpose:
o	This S3 bucket is used to store static files for the frontend (e.g., index.html, CSS, and JS).
o	The bucket is private, and public access is completely blocked via the PublicAccessBlockConfiguration property.
o	The bucket is configured for static website hosting with index.html as the default document.
________________________________________
Step 2: Create CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI)
•	Resource: CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity
•	Purpose:
o	This OAI acts as an intermediary between CloudFront and the S3 bucket.
o	It ensures that only CloudFront can access the private S3 bucket, preventing direct access by users.
________________________________________
Step 3: Create S3 Bucket Policy
•	Resource: S3BucketPolicy
•	Purpose:
o	This bucket policy grants read-only access to the OAI so that CloudFront can fetch objects (e.g., index.html) from the private S3 bucket.
o	The Principal is set to the OAI's unique ID, ensuring secure access.
________________________________________
Step 4: Create the CloudFront Distribution
•	Resource: CloudFrontDistribution
•	Purpose:
o	Distributes the frontend files globally via edge locations for fast access.
o	Uses the OAI to securely access the S3 bucket.
o	Redirects HTTP traffic to HTTPS (ViewerProtocolPolicy: redirect-to-https).
o	Serves the index.html file as the default document.
o	Configures custom error responses (e.g., for 403 errors) to redirect users to /.
________________________________________
Step 5: Create the DynamoDB Table
•	Resource: MeetingsTable
•	Purpose:
o	Stores meeting data, such as meetingId, status, date, startTime, and endTime.
o	Uses a global secondary index (StatusIndex) to efficiently query meetings by status (e.g., "pending", "approved") and date.
________________________________________
Step 6: Create the Cognito User Pool
•	Resource: CognitoUserPool
•	Purpose:
o	Manages authentication for the application.
o	Allows users to sign in using their email, with email verification enabled.
o	Provides an admin creation flow for adding users to the pool.
•	Supporting Resources:

NETWORKING


1. Frontend Networking
S3 Bucket and CloudFront
•	Connection:
o	The CloudFront Distribution retrieves static content (e.g., index.html) from the S3 bucket.
o	The S3 bucket policy explicitly allows the CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI) to fetch content.
•	Networking Flow:
o	The S3 bucket is private and configured with PublicAccessBlockConfiguration to ensure no public access.
o	The OAI acts as a secure intermediary, allowing only CloudFront to access the bucket.
o	Users access the frontend via the CloudFrontDistributionUrl, which serves the website globally through CloudFront edge locations.
________________________________________
2. API Gateway and Backend Networking
API Gateway and Lambda Functions
•	Connection:
o	API Gateway exposes REST API endpoints (e.g., GET /meetings, POST /chatbot) for users.
o	Each API route is integrated with a specific Lambda function to handle the request.
•	Networking Flow:
o	API Gateway invokes Lambda functions securely using AWS Proxy integrations.
o	The AWS::Lambda::Permission resource ensures API Gateway has explicit permission to invoke each Lambda function.
Authentication via Cognito
•	Connection:
o	API Gateway integrates with Cognito User Pool to authenticate users via JWT tokens.
o	The JWTAuthorizer in API Gateway ensures that only authenticated users can access the API endpoints.
•	Networking Flow:
o	Users log in via Cognito, and the frontend obtains a JWT token.
o	The JWT token is included in the Authorization header of API requests.
o	API Gateway validates the token with Cognito before routing the request to the Lambda function.
________________________________________
3. Data Layer Networking
Lambda Functions and DynamoDB
•	Connection:
o	Lambda functions interact with the DynamoDB table (MeetingsTable) for storing, querying, or updating meeting data.
•	Networking Flow:
o	Each Lambda function is assigned an IAM execution role with specific permissions for DynamoDB operations:
	dynamodb:GetItem, dynamodb:Query for read operations.
	dynamodb:UpdateItem, dynamodb:PutItem for write/update operations.
o	These permissions are defined in inline IAM policies attached to the Lambda roles.
Policies and Access Control:
•	The GetMeetingsLambdaFunction can:
o	Query the StatusIndex of the MeetingsTable to fetch approved meetings.
•	The ChangeMeetingStatusLambdaFunction can:
o	Update the status of a specific meeting in DynamoDB.
•	The LexLambdaFunction can:
o	Insert a new meeting into the table with a "pending" status.
o	Query the StatusIndex to check for scheduling conflicts.
________________________________________
4. Chatbot Networking
Frontend and Chatbot
•	Connection:
o	Users interact with the chatbot via the POST /chatbot route exposed by API Gateway.
o	API Gateway invokes the ChatbotLambdaFunction to process the user's input.
ChatbotLambdaFunction and Amazon Lex
•	Connection:
o	The ChatbotLambdaFunction sends the user's message to Amazon Lex (MeetyBot) for processing.
o	Lex determines the intent (e.g., BookMeeting) and collects slot values (e.g., date, time, email).
•	Networking Flow:
o	The ChatbotLambdaFunction uses an IAM execution role that includes permissions to call Lex APIs (e.g., lexv2-runtime:RecognizeText).
o	The Lex bot, in turn, invokes the LexLambdaFunction to handle booking logic and integrate with DynamoDB.
________________________________________
5. Networking in Lex Integration
Lex and DynamoDB
•	Connection:
o	The Lex bot (MeetyBot) uses the LexLambdaFunction to execute backend operations such as:
	Checking for scheduling conflicts in DynamoDB.
	Creating new meeting records in the MeetingsTable.
•	Networking Flow:
o	The LexLambdaFunction is granted access to the DynamoDB table via its IAM execution role.
o	The Lex bot itself is assigned the MeetyRuntimeRole, which allows it to:
	Interact with external services like Polly (for text-to-speech) and Comprehend (for sentiment analysis).
________________________________________
6. Secure Communication
IAM Policies
•	Lambda Execution Roles:
o	Each Lambda function has a dedicated IAM role with least-privilege permissions, ensuring it can only access the specific resources it needs (e.g., DynamoDB, Lex).
•	S3 Bucket Policy:
o	Explicitly allows the CloudFront OAI to access the private bucket, blocking all other access.
•	API Gateway Permissions:
o	Explicit permissions (AWS::Lambda::Permission) are defined to allow API Gateway to invoke each Lambda function.
________________________________________
7. User Flow Example
Here’s how the components interact during a typical user action (e.g., booking a meeting):
1.	User accesses the frontend:
o	The website is served from the S3 bucket via CloudFront.
2.	User logs in:
o	Cognito authenticates the user and provides a JWT token.
3.	User interacts with the chatbot:
o	The frontend sends the user’s input (e.g., "Book a meeting") to API Gateway (POST /chatbot).
4.	API Gateway routes the request:
o	The ChatbotLambdaFunction processes the request and sends it to Lex.
5.	Lex processes the intent:
o	The Lex bot (MeetyBot) identifies the intent (BookMeeting), collects slot values (e.g., date, time, email), and invokes the LexLambdaFunction.
6.	Lex Lambda checks DynamoDB:
o	The LexLambdaFunction checks the MeetingsTable for scheduling conflicts and inserts a new meeting record if no conflict exists.
7.	Response sent back to the user:
o	The Lex bot sends a confirmation message back to the ChatbotLambdaFunction, which forwards it to the frontend.
